## Foreword

As the demands to reform our current technology can be seen to be mentioned at various talks, interviews and discussions, we are also at the confluence of eras of two different versions of the internet that will push us to our destiny. In a 2018 [TED talk](https://youtu.be/xHHb7R3kx40), historian **Yuval Noah Harrari** told us how our personal data on the internet can fuel up a fascist government. The broad changes that the Web 3.0 is expected to bring to the industry of information sharing and the method of will be a shower of boon to the users and developers of the coming generation.

## The Need for a Change

Web 3.0, as the name suggests, is the third generation of internet service which will introduce a revolutionary system by changing in how developers create their websites and more importantly, how users interact, share and store their vulnerable informations on the web. There's actually no proper definition of Web 3.0 as it is still under development since 2006, the year when it was first coined by **Darci DiNucci**. The ultimate goal of Web 3.0 is to create more intelligent, versatile and secured websites with a fair amount of surge in data sharing speed and building a robust system to increase the reliability of availability of information from several corners of the internet using machine based understanding of data. There’s more to the topic under discussion as for why is it of so much importance and the potential it carries to help us march towards a more fair world. But before we explore more about 3.0, we definitely need to have a quick look back on its predecessors.

## The Foundations

The genesis of the internet that we surf today was marked by the Web 1.0. It wasn't coined until the Web 2.0 came into the market. It was the first phase of the set of services available on the World Wide Web. It was portrayed by a bunch of static websites (webpages which were more or less like images) carrying pages of informations but lacking the interactive features that the users and developers were steadily wishing for to work effortlessly. Moreover, the internet was staggeringly slow with a bare hope to download contents and streaming videos and music was out of questions. The developers had to put an enormous amount of laborious job, compared to today, to alter a tiny bit of data on the page. To stack up more to their misery, the users were needed to dial up through modems using landline phones for connecting to the internet. It seemed people would rather not use it.

With the commencement of faster internet speed, optical cables, robust and reliable gadgets and application, there was a gradual but final end to all the agony. Now it was possible for developers to upload, edit and create within a matter of seconds and it became feasible for users to participate in sharing of information. Gradually, with various online tools and services, the community of developers or website hosts became very vast and included common people from all corners of the world. We know how social networking sites and media has allowed us to connect with friends and channel our thoughts and creations to a platform from where the whole world can access. This changed the prospect of the functioning of businesses, handling of items and commodities and also added new opportunities.

With such sweeping changes in technology, it was obvious for bunch of criticism to follow along sooner or later. Though some were quite trivial, like the creator of _WWW_ describing the term to be a 'jargon' and claimed it to be no different than its previous version, some criticism was quite meaningful to take into consideration. For instance, the Sunday Times reviewer John Flintoff characterising Web 2.0 as **"creating an endless digital forest of mediocrity"** spreading misinformation and poor quality contents. But there was more to the disadvantages of Web 2.0 that can have more devastating effects to our society and as an individual which is already lurking over our head like cumulonimbus.

## The Bad and the Ugly

A sudden explosion of internet users was witnessed in the late 2000s jumping from 738 million to 3.2 billion internet users by 2015. As a result, the internet started being flooded with plenty of information, mostly of which are sensitive and private leaving us under the giant paws of hackers, forgers and spies. However, most of the users takes precautionary measures and many are still not under their radar but the statistics can make anyone worry about their security.

</div>

The big eyes that were on those swarming fishes was of the telemarketers. To pivot the valuable assets into profitability was instantaneously realised by the tech giants like Amazon, Google and Facebook. They created a business where they could provide essential and extravagant services (which now people take them for granted) to the clients without any monetary transactions but instead they would be eligible sell the data to potential advertisers to help them pop up banners whenever you connect to the internet. There are even many claims about some mischievous conducts by the companies to avail huge benefits for themselves. As scary as it may seem, the clients hardly bother to care about it rendering their personal information as insignificant. Moreover, it can be witnessed sometimes how these tech giants try to promote their political agendas by banning, grouping and feeding biased posts on their media. Additionally, government and police intelligence can have easy access to significant whereabouts and the ideas cultivating by people under their power. The grasp can be leveraged to curb out motives which they are resistant to. So, how much of potential does Web 3.0 has to swallow all the curses of its predecessors?

## The New Internet

Let's be clear on this, the semantic web is not a single device, software or a complex that will one day set foot in and the whole web experience will be changed. It’s rather a collection of concepts that have been floating around for a while now in addition with few others in as developing brainchild of few geniuses. Three of the concepts that are already in the mainstream market are Smart home appliances, Internet of Things and virtual assistant. The terms that are on spotlights from the next gen web are:

1. Decentralization
2. Machine Learning
3. Speed 
4. Reliability

Decentralization is the most hyped word among all the other features and can actually be the crucial point in the terms of carrying betterment for the multitude. Contrary to the present, the environment of the web will not be sustainable for monopoly and it will propagate more privacy. With the abolishment of centralised data storing and accessing, the control of information and action executed by the powerful authorities will die out and people will not be banned based on region, gender, income and other various factors. Peer-to-peer network, a concept built in 1970s, will be more focussed on for data distribution among the users in the network, named as peers, to store multimedia files like music, video, etc. with their unique codes or hash to prevent them from tampering which can later be accessed by establishing Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Data Protocol (UDP) connections. Block chains, a type of distributed ledger, can be used to maintain a reliable and forgery-proof transactional history of cryptocurrency which will abolish the need of banks as middlemen. P2P and blockchain are very broad subjects which needs articles of their own.

Machine Learning could be used to analyse and process for uniform distribution of load and keeping track of the management during retrieval of the media. With the help of AI, the data could be systematically managed within the web and could be routed to the preferred destination, 80 percent faster than the current client-server architecture. With the help of AI, it is already possible to control the home appliances and other gadgets that were once barred from the internet because they lacked communication skills. Speed will definitely increase in various aspect of the net due to the removal of a centralised server carrying and processing all the load and the middlemen in verifying several transactions in addition to the presence of Artificial Intelligence contributing to spike the numbers real high. Reliability, as there will be dramatic decrease in hacks and data breaches because the data will be decentralised and intrusion by terrorist will be reduced to negligence. Allowing the use of cryptocurrencies like BitCoin will severely drop the mishaps observed during several financial transactions. Moreover, the chances of the service disruption will also hit the lowest and multiple backups can be ensured.

## The Future of Internet

Now the big question that must be asked is, ‘How it must be implemented?’ Well, it might sometimes feel like a type of work only tech geeks could use and obviously there will be a change in all the present devices to accommodate the future technology but that’s a later concern. For starters, to transit into the world of semantic web, we need to shift from our regular applications to dApps. For example, Social media app like streemit, DTube could be used instead of Reddit and Youtube for conversations and multimedia sharing. Browsers like Brave could be used instead of Google Chrome. Services like IPFS could be used instead of Google Drive for online storage and data distribution. These are few examples and as 3.0 is brought more under limelight, some other reliable apps are destined to emerge. While its vastness and vagueness can perplex any common netizens which is obviously hindering the establishment of the technology in market, the great deal of flaws in machine learning and incompetent nature of AI in present with respect to the decision-making done by humans is also another common factor that is slowing down the process. But, in the coming dates, the people will eventually adopt to it and developing technologies will give a boost to this revolution in production.

Well, web 3.0 could be the next big change we need for a better and safer nations. I can see our lifestyle building upon the foundation laid by the contributors and collective creators of this next generation. Your basic role is to make yourself known of the possibilities it carries to reform the underground wires that hold our society together.
