Hi, I am Sagnik. I'll break the ice! A little bit about myself - I love to spend time with family and friends. I also happen to be a self-taught programming enthusiast. My primary interests are Web Development and AI and the bridge between the two. I graduated as a Bachelor in Technology in the field of Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology Agartala. I am hoping to study AI in the near future. Please use the Social Links towards the bottom of this page to reach out to me. I'd love to hear from you too!
